# 🏗️ Speech Recognition Transcriber - Architecture

This document outlines the architecture, design decisions, components, and workflow of the Speech Recognition Transcriber project.

## 🔍 System Overview

The Speech Recognition Transcriber is a Python application that uses the SpeechRecognition library to convert spoken language into text and store it in a markdown format. The system captures audio from a microphone, processes it using Google's Speech-to-Text API, and saves the transcribed content.

## 🧩 Components

### 📚 Core Libraries

- **SpeechRecognition**: The primary library that provides an interface to various speech recognition APIs
- **PyAudio**: Handles the audio input/output streams, allowing the application to capture audio from the microphone
- **time**: Used for implementing delays to manage system resources
- **os**: Provides operating system dependent functionality (file operations)

### ⚙️ Key Functions

#### 🎤 `recognize_speech_from_mic(recognizer, microphone)`

This function serves as the core component of the application and handles:
- Ambient noise adjustment
- Audio capture from microphone
- Speech-to-text conversion
- Error handling

Return value: A dictionary containing:
- `success`: Boolean indicating if transcription was successful
- `error`: Error message if applicable
- `transcription`: The transcribed text

#### 🔄 Main Execution Loop

The main execution loop in `__main__` handles:
- Instance creation of recognizer and microphone
- Continuous listening for input
- Processing of speech recognition results
- File I/O for storing transcriptions
- Termination condition monitoring

## 🔄 Technical Workflow

1. **🚀 Initialization**:
   - Create instances of `Recognizer` and `Microphone` classes
   - Define output file path

2. **🎤 Audio Capture**:
   - Adjust for ambient noise to improve accuracy
   - Capture audio through microphone
   - Listen for speech input

3. **🧠 Speech Recognition**:
   - Send captured audio to Google Web Speech API
   - Receive transcribed text or error response

4. **⚙️ Response Processing**:
   - Handle successful transcription
   - Process API unavailability errors
   - Handle unintelligible speech

5. **📝 Output Generation**:
   - Format transcribed text with bullet points
   - Append content to markdown file
   - Display feedback to user in console

6. **🎮 Session Control**:
   - Monitor for the termination phrase "close this conversation"
   - Implement small delays to prevent high CPU usage
   - Provide completion message when session ends

## ⚠️ Error Handling

The application implements two primary error handling scenarios:

1. **🔌 API Unavailability** (`sr.RequestError`):
   - Occurs when Google's Speech Recognition API is unreachable
   - Sets success status to False
   - Sets error message to "API unavailable"
   - Reports the issue to the user

2. **🤔 Unintelligible Speech** (`sr.UnknownValueError`):
   - Occurs when the speech cannot be recognized or understood
   - Sets success status to False
   - Sets error message to "Unable to recognize speech"
   - Reports the issue to the user

## 💡 Design Decisions

1. **📋 Markdown Output Format**:
   - Bullet-pointed format for easy readability
   - Simple text format for maximum compatibility
   - Easy integration with note-taking systems

2. **🔄 Continuous Listening Mode**:
   - Allows for natural conversation flow
   - Eliminates need for manual start/stop
   - Implementation of termination phrase for user control

3. **🔊 Ambient Noise Adjustment**:
   - 5-second calibration period improves recognition accuracy
   - Automatically adapts to different environments
   - Enhances user experience in various settings

4. **🌐 Google Web Speech API**:
   - High accuracy for general speech recognition
   - Wide language support
   - No API key required for basic usage
   - Trade-off: Requires internet connection

5. **💻 Simple Console Interface**:
   - Minimal dependencies
   - Focus on core functionality
   - Cross-platform compatibility

## ⚡ Performance Considerations

1. **💪 CPU Usage Management**:
   - Added time.sleep(0.5) to prevent high CPU utilization
   - Balance between responsiveness and resource usage

2. **🔁 Error Recovery**:
   - System continues operation after recognition failures
   - Provides user feedback for troubleshooting

3. **💾 File I/O Optimization**:
   - Opens and closes file for each write operation
   - Ensures data is saved even if program terminates unexpectedly
   - Trade-off: More file operations but better data integrity
